### Fixed
- Fixed AprilTag detector initialization error with undefined tag family variable
- Fixed robot interface disconnect method call (should be `close()` not `disconnect()`)
- Improved error handling and validation in AprilTag detector initialization
- Added better diagnostics for AprilTag detector failures
- Fixed camera calibration file loading in AprilTag detector
- Resolved import errors for camera module (`picam`) in CLI and detection modules
- Updated `camera/picam/__init__.py` to properly expose `PiCam` and `PiCamConfig` classes
- Fixed import paths in `apriltag_detection.py` and `teach_positions.py` to use proper Python package structure
- Corrected sys.path management for cross-module imports

### Changed
- Updated `robots/ur/ur_robot_interface.py` to use centralized configuration
- Updated `apriltag_detection.py` to use centralized configuration  
- All modules now import from `config_manager` instead of individual config files
- Configuration values now support dot notation access (e.g., `robot.ip_address`)
- Command-line arguments now override config file values consistently

### Improved
- Simplified configuration management - single source of truth
- Better path handling - no more broken references when moving files
- Consistent configuration access patterns across all modules
- Built-in defaults and graceful fallbacks
- Configuration validation and debugging capabilities

### Removed
- handeye_calibration/ directory and all hand-eye calibration scripts: collect_handeye_data.py, calculate_handeye_calibration.py, coordinate_transformer.py, etc.
- handeye_rework/ directory and experimental calibration approaches
- Hand-eye calibration related files from root: handeye_result.yaml, handeye_samples.json, analyze_motion.py, check_distances.py, test_close_distance.py
- Hand-eye calibration sections from README.md, simplified to focus on pure AprilTag detection workflow
- Individual config files (`camera_client_config.yaml`, `robots/ur/robot_config.yaml`) - now consolidated

### Rationale
- Hand-eye calibration was not producing realistic results
- AprilTag detection works effectively without requiring camera-to-robot transformation
- Simplified codebase focuses on core functionality: camera capture, AprilTag detection, and robot control as separate components
- handeye_rework/collect_samples.py: implemented real robot/camera/apriltag hooks using existing interfaces
- Configuration consolidation eliminates path issues and simplifies system management

## [2025-09-12] - Camera Coordinate Frame Correction for Hand-Eye Calibration

### Added
- `tests/test_camera_coordinate_frame.py` - Empirical camera frame mapping test with automatic robot movement
- Coordinate frame correction in `calculate_handeye_calibration.py` 
- Camera-to-robot coordinate transformation matrix based on empirical testing

### Changed
- Updated hand-eye calibration to account for OpenCV camera frame vs robot frame differences
- Robot X+ (RIGHT) → Camera X+, Robot Y+ (BACK) → Camera Z+, Robot Z+ (UP) → Camera Y+
- Applied coordinate transformation: Camera [X,Y,Z] → Robot [X,Z,-Y]

### Fixed
- Hand-eye calibration offset issue (~0.95m → expected 10-30cm) by correcting coordinate frame mismatch
- Camera pose data now properly transformed from OpenCV convention to robot frame before calibration

### Changed
- Moved debugging and testing utilities from main directory to `tests/`

### Fixed
- Removed incorrect Ry/Rz sign corrections - raw RTDE readings now match teach pendant
